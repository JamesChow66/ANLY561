    "We let $\\mathbb{R}$ denote the set of real numbers. Suppose $f:\\mathbb{R}\\rightarrow\\mathbb{R}$ is a real-valued function. An *optimization program* involves a search for the largest (or, smallest) value $f$ attains, as well as any possible points $x$ for which $f(x)$ is exactly this largest (or, smallest) value. Such an $f$ is often called an *objective function* or just an *objective*.\n",

    "It then follows that any maximization program is equivalent to the minimization program involving the negated function. Thus, we need only consider minimization programs when we talk about optimization.\n",

Similarly, a *maximum value* of $f$ is a value $q$ satisfying $f(x)\\leq q$ for all $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$ and if $f(x)\\leq y$ for all $x\\in\\mathbb{R}$, then $q\\leq y$.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Group Problems\n",
    "1. Write down a function which does not have a minimum value.\n",

    "## Constrained Optimization\n",

    "\n",
    "Any point $x\\in X$ is called a *feasible point* or just *feasible*, and the set $X$ is often called the *feasible region*, *region of optimization*, or *set of feasible points*. If $x\\not\\in X$, then $x$ is *not feasible*. If $X$ contains no points (i.e. $X$ is the empty set, or $X=\\emptyset$), then the program $(P)$ is called *infeasible*.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important considerations\n",
    "1. Does $(P_\\min)$ have a minimum value?\n",
    "2. Does $(P_\\min)$ have a solution?\n",
    "3. Does $(P_\\min)$ have a **unique** solution?\n",
    "4. When $(P_\\min)$ has a solution $x_\\ast$, are there algorithms for producing a numerical approximation $\\widetilde{x}$ which is close to $x_\\ast$?\n",
    "5. When $(P_\\min)$ has a solution $x_\\ast$, if $\\widetilde{x}$ is close to $x_\\ast$, then is $f(\\widetilde{x})$ close to $f(x_ast)$?\n",

    "Without imposing additional structure on $f$, the answers to these questions are generally ``no.`` In each of the following sections, we explore conditions on $f$ which allow us to know when the answers to the above questions are ``yes.``\n",
